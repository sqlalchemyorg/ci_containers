# build optional axes on a matrix build

# this is used to test selected gerrits on newer python versions
# (or could be adapted to other kinds of axes too, like for dogpile.cache
# etc.)

# this script first checks the matrix node for a certain value,
# like "py314", meaning we're building Python 3.14.   If so, it looks at git
# commit message and checks for a string like "py314: yes".  If present,
# the script proceeds.   If not present, it calls exit, so that the build
# does not run.
